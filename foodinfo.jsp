<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">USDA is doing its part to help make preventing food waste the first-best option for farmers, businesses, organizations, and consumers. A large number of USDA programs contribute to this objective, ranging from those supporting market and distributional efficiencies to those educating consumers about safe food storage. Selected new and ongoing activities directly contributing to the reduction of food loss and waste are listed below.

<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">Information on Funding Opportunities for Projects and Research Targeting Food Loss and Waste Prevention
USDA’s Rural Development has developed a guide (PDF, 3.0 MB) to programs that could potentially provide funding for food loss and waste reduction projects. USDA's National Institute of Agriculture (NIFA) has developed a guide (PDF, 130 KB) to programs that provide funding for research on food loss and waste.

</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia;;color:black;"><b>Consumer Education about Food Loss and Waste</b></h3> 
<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">Consumers account for a large share of food loss and waste in the United States. To help inform them about food waste, the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion has developed a new infographic, Let’s Talk Trash, with information on food loss and waste facts and reduction tips. Moreover, a new section on MyPlate.gov will educate consumers about reducing food waste to help stretch household budgets. The potential audience for this outreach is large. Since the launch of MyPlate in 2011, MyPlate.gov has become a popular federal resource for consumers seeking information on nutrition and health. The number of visitors has grown from 6.5 million in 2011 to 50.6 million in August 2015 and the site received more than 288 million page views. Facts about food waste and tips to help consumers reduce will be a valuable addition to MyPlate.gov as USDA strives to motivate food waste reduction.

<h4 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia;;color:black;"><b>Consumer Education about Food Storage</b></h4> 
<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">Some consumer-level loss arises from consumers or retailers throwing away wholesome food because of confusion about how to safely store it or about the meaning of dates stamped on the label. USDA, through the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), educates consumers about the importance of safe food storage as a means of reducing the risks of acquiring a foodborne illness. As part of its food waste reduction outreach, USDA recently updated the safe-storage and date-labeling information on the FSIS website and updated and expanded online FoodKeeper Resource. In spring 2015, USDA also launched (in partnership with the Food Marketing Institute and Cornell University) a FoodKeeper App to provide consumers with easy access to clear, scientific information on food storage, proper storage temperatures, food product dating, and expiration dates. (The app is available on FoodSafety.gov for those that do not have access to smart phones or tablets. There users can get all the same storage guidance on their desktop or laptop machines.) FSIS is working to update and launching a 2.0 version of the FoodKeeper app.

<h4 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia;;color:black;"><b>Benefits of Food Waste Management Projects</b></h4> 
<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black">The food waste management initiatives of Aradhaya Food Recycle have numerous advantages. These initiatives not only lessen the impact of food waste on the environment but also boost local economies and communities. Aradhaya Food Recycle is able to encourage sustainability and resilience in the face of global issues by utilising the potential of organic waste.

</p>
<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">The amount of food waste that occurs worldwide is astounding; every year, millions of tonnes of edible food are disposed away in landfills. In addition to its negative effects on the environment, food waste makes resource depletion and food insecurity worse. In order to meet this problem, food waste management strategies that prioritise reduction, recycling, and reuse must be comprehensive and proactive.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Georgia;color:black;">The methodology of Aradhaya Food Recycle is centred around community education and engagement. In order to inspire people to take action and increase public awareness of the value of food waste management, the company maintains tight links with the local community. Aradhaya Food Recycle promotes a sustainable and conscientious consumer culture through workshops, outreach programmes, and educational activities.
