<h2 style="text-align:center;" >Aboutus</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Food loss and waste occurs at all stages of the food supply chain – production, processing, sales, and consumption. Definitions of what constitutes food loss versus food waste or what parts of foods (i.e., inedible parts) exit the food supply chain are considered lost or wasted vary.[12] Terms are often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of waste).[13][14] Professional bodies, including international organizations, state governments, and secretariats may use their own definitions.</p>
<p>The 2024 UNEP Food Waste Index Report, "Think Eat Save: Tracking Progress to Halve Global Food Waste," addresses the severe issue of food waste that accounts for US$1 trillion in losses, 8–10% of global greenhouse emissions, and the unnecessary use of 30% of the world's agricultural land, exacerbating hunger and affecting child growth. In alignment with SDG 12.3, the report compiles 194 data points from 93 countries to illustrate the widespread nature of food waste, highlights the lack of disparity in waste levels across nations of varying income levels, and underscores the leadership roles of Japan and the UK among G20 nations in data tracking.</p>
